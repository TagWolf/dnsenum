# dnsenum
DNS Enumeration Script and Bruteforce Lists I've compiled by hand

Finds a shitload of hostnames and subdomains for an existing domain.

VERY noisy at the nameserver level. But your target will likely never see any of that traffic.

Use responsible, no illegal activity!



Future plans:

Expand existing script to use intellegent prefixes and word creation from list types and categories.
